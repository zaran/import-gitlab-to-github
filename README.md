# import-gitlab-to-githb
Import GitLab repos into GitHub

Edit: Turns out the endpoint to import repos has been deprecated :( - I got this error:
```
[error] importing [REPO-NAME]: {"message":"This endpoint has been deprecated. To import a repository, please use the GitHub Importer tool at https://github.com/new/import.","documentation_url":"https://docs.github.com/rest","status":"404"}
```
